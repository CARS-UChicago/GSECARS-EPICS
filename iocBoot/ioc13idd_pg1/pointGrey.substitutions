# Note.  These substutitions are mostly generic.
# However the PINI, PINI_VALB, and PINI_ABS fields should be changed to only be
# YES for the features the camera actually supports in device or absolute
# mode, otherwise error messages will appear on startup.
# One would normally set either PINI or PINI_ABS to YES (but not both) because
# if they are both YES the results are unpredictable, depending
# on which happens last. 
# PINI_VALB should only be set to YES for the WhiteBalance property in color cameras 
# that support WhiteBalance.
