# re-implementation of 2d rotation (see sumDiff2D.db)
# real perpendicular motors (P)(M1) and (P)(M1) are moved to make 
# two soft motors (P)(SUM) and (P)(DIFF) as the weighted 
# average and difference of the two real motors.  The weighting factors are 
# as follows:
# SUM  = (( (P)(M1) * (P)(SUM)C1 ) + ( (P)(M2) * (P)(SUM)C2 )) 
# DIFF = (( (P)(M1) * (P)(DIFF)C1) - ( (P)(M2) * (P)(DIFF)C2)) 

# These two records are where the soft motors write their output.
# They are needed because writing to a transform record field does not
# cause the record to process?
# We use forward links to the transform record (rather than making the INPA and
# INPB fields of the transform record CP) so that the scan record waits 
# for the motors to move.

# This record is processed whenever the soft motor records SUM or DIFF write
# new values to the DVAL records above.
# Note: the INPA and INPB fields get their values directly from the .DVAL
# fields of the soft motor records, rather than from the DVAL record above.
# This is because the .DVAL fields are always correct, while the DVAL records
# do not get updated when the soft motor .DVAL fields are modified in SET mode.
